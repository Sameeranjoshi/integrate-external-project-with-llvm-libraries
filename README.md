# integrate-external-project-with-llvm-libraries
Make use of the libraries provided by LLVM framework, and create your own tool on top of that.

# Steps to build
```bash
git clone 
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../proj
make
```
Note: You need `llvm` compiler setup in your environment.
The tool does nothing just uses one of the LLVM based libraries.
